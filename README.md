# Trim

**Debloat Windows 10 and 11 without breaking it.**

Strips out ads, telemetry and preinstalled junk, tunes what's left for games,
and shows you every change before it makes one.

## What it does

**Removes the junk** — advertising ID, telemetry, activity history, suggested
content, Copilot, Widgets, Bing in Start, inking and typing collection, speech,
feedback prompts, and preinstalled apps. Edge too, if you want it: the browser
only, leaving WebView2 so apps that render with it keep working.

**Tunes for games** — Game Bar and background recording off, windowed-game
optimisations on, foreground CPU priority, hardware GPU scheduling, and every
installed game pointed at your real GPU. Steam, Epic, Xbox, GOG, EA, Ubisoft and
Battle.net libraries are all found. On NVIDIA it also applies a driver profile
composed for your exact card — a 5070 Ti gets multi-frame generation settings a
1660 doesn't, and sending the wrong ones makes the driver reject the lot.

**Clears disk space** — 13 categories across every drive, each itemised with its
size and location before anything goes. Plus a duplicate finder and a
report-only large-file scanner.

**Uninstalls properly** — runs the app's own uninstaller, then finds the
folders, registry keys, services and scheduled tasks it left behind, and names
the ones it found but will not touch. Registry keys and services are exported
to `.reg` first, tasks to `.xml`. Services and tasks are never ticked for you.

**Controls startup** — everything that runs at sign-in, from the Run keys, both
Startup folders and logon scheduled tasks, each with its publisher and where it
is configured.

Underneath: privacy, network, scheduled-task, service and performance phases,
plus the WinUtil tweak set ([credits](#credits)). Twelve phases in total.

## Undo

Every registry write records the previous value first. At the end of the run —
including after a crash — that becomes a rollback script:

```
C:\ProgramData\Trim\undo\undo_<timestamp>.ps1
```

Run it whenever, and every value returns to exactly what it was. Values that
didn't exist before are removed, not zeroed.

A System Restore point is taken before the plan is applied — where Windows allows
one. Machines with System Protection off by policy refuse, and the run says so on
screen and in the
log rather than letting you assume you have a rollback you don't. Startup
shortcuts are moved, not deleted. Registry keys are exported to `.reg` before a
deep uninstall. NVIDIA's previous profile is exported to `.nip`.

Three things it can't take back: removed Store apps, WinUtil's own changes (use
the restore point), and `netsh` TCP settings — one command, printed in the log.

## Safety

- Nothing in the plan changes until you click Apply. A run with no arguments
  always opens the window; applying without it takes an explicit `-Apply`. The
  Startup, Cleanup and Uninstall panes are separate: each asks before it acts,
  and acts when you say yes.
- Admin is asked for once, at the start, because several of the values being
  read need it. `-DryRun` is the exception and grants nothing.
- Only SAFE is ticked by default. CAUTION and RISKY are opt-in.
- Camera, microphone, screenshots and screen recording are never touched —
  enforced at runtime and asserted by the tests.
- No BIOS, fan curves, undervolting or overclocking.
- Shared runtimes, winget and Xbox sign-in are protected from removal.
- Hardware and Windows version are detected, not assumed.
- No analytics, no account, no telemetry. It contacts two hosts and no others:
  this site for the script, its fingerprint and the WinUtil config; and GitHub
  for WinUtil, if that phase is kept, and NVIDIA Profile Inspector, each pinned
  to one release and its SHA256, plus Chris Titus Tech's PowerShell profile if
  you tick it, which is not pinned. All three are somebody else's code, fetched
  at run time.
- It installs nothing, and writes four things: its log, its ledger and the undo
  script in `C:\ProgramData\Trim`, plus a copy of itself in the temp folder when
  it elevates — an elevated shell gets a file it can hash, not a second download
  it cannot.

## Verifying it

**Read it** — served as plain text, not a download: <https://trimbloat.com/go>

**Check the fingerprint** — published at <https://trimbloat.com/sha256>, and
`-Version` prints the hash of the file on your machine.

**Build it yourself** — the build is reproducible, so the same commit gives
byte-identical output. CI checks this on every push.

The compiled script names the commit it came from on line 4, and `main` may
have moved since it was published — check that commit out, or the hashes will
differ for a reason nothing tells you about.

```powershell
git clone https://github.com/serrebidev/trim
cd trim
git checkout <commit>   # line 4 of trim.ps1: "Source: commit ..."
.\build.ps1
```

## Requirements

Windows 10 or 11, and Windows PowerShell 5.1 (ships with Windows) or
PowerShell 7+. Admin rights to apply changes; the dry run needs none.

## Usage

With no arguments it opens the window — which is what the one-liner does. The
plan changes nothing until you click Apply; the Startup, Cleanup and Uninstall
panes each ask first and act when you say yes.

```powershell
.\trim.ps1
```

| Flag | |
|---|---|
| `-Apply` | Apply from the command line: no window, no prompt |
| `-DryRun` | Print the plan, change nothing |
| `-Gui` | Open the window (this is the default) |
| `-Skip Appx,Network` | Leave phases out |
| `-Only Gaming,Graphics` | Run only those phases |
| `-Cleanup` | Include the disk cleanup scan |
| `-LargeFiles` | Report the biggest files on every drive |
| `-NoRestorePoint` | Skip the restore point |
| `-Version` | Print the version and this file's SHA256 |

## Credits

Trim's WinUtil phase invokes
**[WinUtil by Chris Titus Tech](https://github.com/ChrisTitusTech/winutil)** for
its tweak set rather than reimplementing it. That's one of twelve phases; the
rest is Trim's own.

**[NVIDIA Profile Inspector](https://github.com/Orbmu2k/nvidiaProfileInspector)**
by Orbmu2k writes the driver profile, pinned by version and SHA256.

Licences: [NOTICE.md](NOTICE.md).

## Contributing

```powershell

.\test\Test-UndoRoundTrip.ps1
.\test\Test-MainFlow.ps1
```

New registry writes need a `-Because` and a tier, plus `-MinBuild` / `-MaxBuild`
if the setting only exists on one Windows version. Source files must be UTF-8
with a BOM. The harness checks all of it, and CI runs on `windows-latest` under
Windows PowerShell 5.1.

Change `src/13-gui.ps1` and the harness will ask you to regenerate the
screenshots, because the README shows them:

```powershell
powershell -STA -File test\Export-GuiScreenshots.ps1
```

Why the contested defaults are what they are: [docs/DECISIONS.md](docs/DECISIONS.md).

`irm | iex` fetches one file, so the modular source compiles into one script.
The build parses its own output and fails if it doesn't compile.

Screenshots are rendered from the running window by
`test\Export-GuiScreenshots.ps1`, against a demo machine — the Overview pane
otherwise prints the motherboard, BIOS version, disk models and volume labels of
whoever generated them. `-Real` renders your own.
